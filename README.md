# Simple_Bank
This Bank/ATM program was the first thing I made in java. I revisited the code and added some small things such as checking Int values
The bank/ATM reads and writes the accounts to accounts.txt file 
you can call an account with the account number.
deposit and withdraw funds from the accounts.
you can make multiple accounts.
